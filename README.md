# JavaCalculator
A simple calculator using the Java AWT and Swing.

I did attempt to do some rudimentary scaling of the calculator as a percentage of available device screen size.

I verified that the code can be viewed and run in the following IDE's:

1.  Eclipse 2021-09
1.  Visual Studio Code 1.63.2
1.  IntelliJ 2021.3.
